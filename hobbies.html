            <p>
                I love gaming. I play a large display of games from Minecraft to Valorant. While I may not be the best, I am always down to play whatever game!
                I also enjoy photography! Photography is a new hobby for me as I have only been taking photos for a year. Itâ€™s a great way to learn how to express myself and be creative.
